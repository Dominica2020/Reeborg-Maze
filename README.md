- Lost in a dark maze Reeborg was exploring and the battery in its flashlight ran out.
- Write a program using an if/elif/else statement so Reeborg can find the exit. 
- The secret is to have Reeborg follow along the right edge of the maze, turning right if it can, going straight ahead if it canâ€™t turn right, or turning left as a last resort.
